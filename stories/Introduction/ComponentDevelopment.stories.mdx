# Component Development

Components consist of a `component` directory in the `src/components` folder and a `Component.stories.js` file.

> The `component` directory should include all the files the component needs and should have as few dependencies as possible.

## To create your first component:

### 1. Create a `component` folder in the `src/components` directory.

### 2. In your `component` folder create a `Component.js` file and paste the following:

```javascript
const Component = () => (
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
);

export default Component;
```

### 3. In your `component` folder create an `index.js` file and paste the following:

```javascript
export { default } from './Component';
```

### 4. Next create a `Component.stories.js` file in the `src/stories` directory with the following:

```javascript
import Component from './index';

import { createMainStory, generateStory } from './index';

const story = createMainStory({
    title: 'Example/Component',
    component: Component,
});

const Template = (args) => <Component {...args} />;

const Greeting = generateStory({
    Template,
    props: {},
});

export { Greeting };
export default story;

```

> This is the minimum required to start developing components with Storybook. For instructions on how to create documentation for your components and how to use the utility functions provided please take a look at the `Documentation` chapter.
